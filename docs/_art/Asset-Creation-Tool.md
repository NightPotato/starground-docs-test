# Asset Creation Tools
So their is various tools that you can use to make assets for your mod. All art for Starground is done in [paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/) (different from Microsoft Paint!). However, I don't recommend this unless you're on Windows, need a general multi-purpose program, and need something free.


### Other Tools
* [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) | currently one of the best and most feature-rich pixel art programs. The source code is available here on GitHub, and can be installed for free if you compile it yourself. 
* [LibreSprite](https://libresprite.github.io) | A Fork of aseprite but fully open-source and free. Some features in aseprite may not be present if adding after the fork.

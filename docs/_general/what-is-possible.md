Due to the nature of Godot Engine, many things are possible and more then you think. So lets cover what is not possible, below is a list of things that is not possible.

-  Implementing Logic that utilizes a Engine Extension
-  Defining a Global/Autoload Script. (Trying to find workaround)
- Creating a mod with C#, C++, or Rust. (Only GDScript is supported.)
